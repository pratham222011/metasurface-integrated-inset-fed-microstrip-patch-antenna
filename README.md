The Metasurface Integrated Patch Antenna project explores how artificially engineered surfaces can be combined with traditional microstrip antennas to overcome their inherent limitations such as low gain, narrow bandwidth, and reduced efficiency.

A conventional inset-fed microstrip patch antenna was first designed to operate at 2.4 GHz on an FR4 substrate. To enhance its performance, a metasurface layer made of copper ring structures was introduced with a small 0.5 mm air gap between the patch and the metasurface. This configuration enables stronger electromagnetic interaction, reduces substrate losses, and tailors the effective permittivity (ε) and permeability (µ) around the antenna.

The metasurface plays a critical role in:

Improving impedance matching → Lower reflection and better energy transfer

1. Enhancing bandwidth → Wider frequency response compared to conventional designs

2. Boosting gain & directivity → More efficient and focused radiation

3. Maintaining compactness → Low-profile and easily integrable in wireless systems

4. The design, simulation, and optimization were carried out using CST Studio Suite, where parameters such as S11 (Return Loss), VSWR, Gain, Efficiency, Directivity, and Farfield patterns were analyzed.

Key Features of the Antenna

1. Resonant frequency tuned to 2.424 GHz with excellent impedance matching (S11 ≈ –30.13 dB)

2. Bandwidth of 205 MHz, significantly broader than typical patch antennas

3. Radiation efficiency ~58%, despite FR4 losses, due to metasurface field focusing

4. Gain of 3.42 dB with improved directivity from the metasurface layer

5. Very low VSWR (1.06) ensuring stable and efficient performance

Applications

The compact, low-profile nature of this antenna makes it highly suitable for modern wireless technologies, including:

1. Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz band)

2. Internet of Things (IoT) devices

3. Bluetooth-enabled systems

4. Wireless routers and access points

5. Portable communication systems
